# Kazakh Finite-State-Transducer

Two simple, sample finite-state transducers for Kazakh.

The first FST is a grapheme-to-phoneme transducer. This translates a given Kazakh word into IPA.

The second FST is a non-comprehensive generative morphology that handles vowel and consonant harmonies. 
A word is inputted to the FST with given grammatical tags and the inflected form of the word is returned.
